# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application that enables users to upload documents and automatically process them through a serverless AWS pipeline. The system will extract text, classify documents, extract entities, and store processed data for search and retrieval.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload Interface
**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents through a simple web interface, so that I can process my documents automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the application THE SYSTEM SHALL display a clean upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects a document file THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the file type and size
3. WHEN a user uploads a valid document THE SYSTEM SHALL store it securely in AWS S3
4. WHEN a document upload is successful THE SYSTEM SHALL display a confirmation message with tracking ID
5. WHEN a document upload fails THE SYSTEM SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2: Document Storage and Pipeline Trigger
**User Story:** As a system, I want to automatically trigger processing when documents are uploaded, so that users don't need to manually initiate processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a document is uploaded to S3 THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically trigger the IDP pipeline
2. WHEN the pipeline is triggered THE SYSTEM SHALL create a processing record in DynamoDB
3. WHEN processing begins THE SYSTEM SHALL update the document status to "processing"
4. WHEN processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL update the document status to "completed"
5. WHEN processing fails THE SYSTEM SHALL update the document status to "failed" with error details

### Requirement 3: Text Extraction
**User Story:** As a system, I want to extract text from uploaded documents, so that the content can be analyzed and processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a document enters the pipeline THE SYSTEM SHALL use AWS Textract to extract text
2. WHEN text extraction is successful THE SYSTEM SHALL store the extracted text in DynamoDB
3. WHEN text extraction fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and mark the document as failed
4. WHEN extracting from multi-page documents THE SYSTEM SHALL preserve page structure and order
5. WHEN processing different document formats THE SYSTEM SHALL handle PDF, PNG, JPG, and TIFF files

### Requirement 4: Document Classification and Entity Extraction
**User Story:** As a user, I want my documents to be automatically classified and have important entities extracted, so that I can better organize and search my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN text extraction is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL classify the document using AWS Comprehend
2. WHEN classification is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL extract entities (people, organizations, locations, dates)
3. WHEN entities are extracted THE SYSTEM SHALL store classification and entities in DynamoDB
4. WHEN classification confidence is low THE SYSTEM SHALL mark the document for manual review
5. WHEN entity extraction finds PII THE SYSTEM SHALL flag the document appropriately

### Requirement 5: Data Storage and Indexing
**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and retrieve my processed documents, so that I can quickly find relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN document processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL index the document for search
2. WHEN a user searches for documents THE SYSTEM SHALL return relevant results based on content and metadata
3. WHEN displaying search results THE SYSTEM SHALL show document title, classification, and key entities
4. WHEN a user selects a document THE SYSTEM SHALL display the full processed information
5. WHEN storing document data THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain data integrity and consistency

### Requirement 6: Processing Status and Monitoring
**User Story:** As a user, I want to track the processing status of my documents, so that I know when they are ready for use.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user queries document status THE SYSTEM SHALL return current processing stage
2. WHEN processing is in progress THE SYSTEM SHALL show estimated completion time
3. WHEN processing encounters errors THE SYSTEM SHALL provide meaningful error descriptions
4. WHEN processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL notify the user of completion
5. WHEN system performance degrades THE SYSTEM SHALL log metrics for monitoring

### Requirement 7: Security and Access Control
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure document security and proper access control, so that sensitive information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN documents are stored THE SYSTEM SHALL encrypt them at rest and in transit
2. WHEN processing documents THE SYSTEM SHALL use secure AWS service communications
3. WHEN accessing documents THE SYSTEM SHALL validate user permissions
4. WHEN handling PII THE SYSTEM SHALL apply appropriate data protection measures
5. WHEN logging activities THE SYSTEM SHALL exclude sensitive information from logs

### Requirement 8: Cost Optimization
**User Story:** As a system owner, I want to minimize processing costs while maintaining performance, so that the solution remains cost-effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN processing documents THE SYSTEM SHALL use serverless architecture to minimize idle costs
2. WHEN storing data THE SYSTEM SHALL use appropriate storage classes for different data types
3. WHEN scaling processing THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically adjust capacity based on demand
4. WHEN processing large volumes THE SYSTEM SHALL batch operations where possible
5. WHEN monitoring costs THE SYSTEM SHALL provide usage and cost visibility
