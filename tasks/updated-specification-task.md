# Updated Specification Task for Intelligent Document Processing Application

## Project Overview
Build an Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application with complete end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Core Requirements

### User Interface
- Simple document upload interface supporting JPEG, PDF, and PNG formats
- Display processing results for each pipeline stage in the frontend
- Real-time progress tracking for document processing

### 5-Stage IDP Pipeline (in order):
1. **File Upload** - Frontend document upload with format validation
2. **Data Extraction** - Extract text and data in JSON format using AWS Textract
3. **Classification** - Classify document type and extract entities using AWS Comprehend
4. **Summarization** - Generate document summary using AWS Bedrock or Comprehend
5. **Results Display** - Show processing results of each task in the frontend

### Testing Requirements
- End-to-end testing with sample documents from ~/ea_sample_docs/idp_docs/
- Test files: Receipt_26Aug2025_084539.pdf, DriversLicense.jpeg, Invoice.png
- Verify all 5 pipeline stages work correctly with all 3 file formats
- Start development server and launch webapp after completion

### Technical Requirements
- AWS serverless architecture (Lambda, S3, API Gateway)
- Real-time processing status updates
- Secure document handling and storage
- Cost-effective solution design
- Frontend framework (React recommended)
- Backend API for pipeline orchestration

## Expected Deliverables
Create specification files in the specs directory:

1. **requirements.md** - Complete functional and non-functional requirements
2. **design.md** - Technical architecture with 5-stage pipeline design
3. **tasks.md** - Implementation tasks including testing and deployment

## Project Directory

## Success Criteria
- All 5 pipeline stages functional
- Support for JPEG, PDF, PNG formats
- End-to-end testing completed successfully
- Development server running with accessible webapp
- Processing results displayed in frontend for each stage
