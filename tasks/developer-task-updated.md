## Core Requirements

### Build Complete IDP Application with 5-Stage Pipeline:

1. **File Upload Frontend**
   - Simple React interface for document upload
   - Support JPEG, PDF, PNG formats
   - File validation and progress indicators

2. **Data Extraction (Stage 1)**
   - Use AWS Textract to extract text and data
   - Return results in JSON format
   - Handle all 3 file formats

3. **Classification (Stage 2)**

   - Extract entities and key information
   - Classify document type (receipt, license, invoice, etc.)

4. **Summarization (Stage 3)**
   - Generate document summary using AWS Bedrock or Comprehend
   - Create concise summary of document content

5. **Results Display (Stage 4)**
   - Display processing results of each stage in frontend
   - Show JSON data extraction results
   - Show classification results
   - Show summarization results
   - Real-time progress tracking

### Testing Requirements
- Perform end-to-end testing with sample documents from ~/ea_sample_docs/idp_docs/
- Test files: Receipt_26Aug2025_084539.pdf, DriversLicense.jpeg, Invoice.png
- Verify all 5 stages work correctly with all 3 file formats

### Deployment Requirements
- Deploy infrastructure using AWS CDK
- Start development server
- Launch webapp and ensure it's accessible
