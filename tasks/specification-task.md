# Specification Task for Intelligent Document Processing Application

## Project Overview
Build an Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application with the following core requirements:

## User Requirements
- Provide a simple user interface for uploading documents
- Once document is uploaded, store it in AWS storage and trigger IDP pipeline
- IDP pipeline needs to perform 3 tasks in the specified order (note: user's message was cut off, but proceed with standard IDP tasks)

## Expected Deliverables
Create the following specification files in the specs directory:

1. **requirements.md** - Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
2. **design.md** - Technical architecture and AWS services design
3. **tasks.md** - Implementation task breakdown

## Project Directory
Work within: /home/pandson/echo-architect-artifacts/intelligent-document-processing-102520251840

## Standard IDP Pipeline Tasks (assume these 3 tasks):
1. Document text extraction using AWS Textract
2. Document classification and entity extraction using AWS Comprehend
3. Data storage and indexing for search and retrieval

## Technical Constraints
- Use AWS services for scalability and reliability
- Implement serverless architecture where possible
- Ensure secure document handling
- Provide cost-effective solution

Please create comprehensive specifications that will guide the development team in building this IDP application.
